This is a plugin supporting Youtube for Showtime. The idea of the plugin is to allow users to do anything they can do with Youtube official website.
This is yet a WIP, so it is not available for public just yet, but should be when development is more advanced.

If you want to donate to the creator (facanferff) please click the link below but read first the notes available too:
1. I don't accept donations for new features.
2. Every donation is a way of thanking the creator for the work he had, so you're not forced to donate.
3. Donations will be used bu the creator in books needed for University or books to advance knowledges in Computer Science.
